# solidity

The purpose of the provided Solidity contract is to create a straightforward token system that enables the minting and burning of tokens. It allows users to define a token's name, abbreviation, and total supply through public variables. The contract uses a mapping structure to keep track of token balances for various addresses. By calling the mint function, the total supply and balance of a specific address can be increased. Conversely, the burn function reduces the total supply and the balance associated with a given address. It is worth noting that the burn function incorporates a safeguard to ensure that the address possesses an adequate balance for token burning. This contract serves as a foundational building block for managing token supply and individual balances in a decentralized manner.
